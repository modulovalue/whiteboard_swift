# whiteboard_swift
(2017)
A rewritten version of my prototype of a whiteboard-like interface in java [whiteboard_java](www.github.com/modulovalue/whiteboard_java).
Died because of my inexperience in building a maintainable architecture and finally killed by Apple by deprecating Swift 3.

It was heavily used as a tool to study for everything and organize data on my desktop in clusters.

Honestly, I would immediately pay for such a tool but I might be completely delusional and it's not all that useful (but it was for me).
I believe a tool like this would have to be totally cross-platform. Java isn't capable of doing that.
Neither is Swift. HTML&JS is, but, well, it's HTML&JS. 

Now that I have the experience and flutter is capable of doing what I need, I'll be rewriting it again, for the third time, in Flutter (one day).
